Server Status Report [ Uptime + Service Status ]
Why

We always need to check server uptime and service status after we reboot the servers every month after the windows update are deployed to the servers.

We can use this script to check the server uptime after we reboot the servers.
If the uptime is more than 4 hours, we will know the server didn't reboot successfully.
If the service showed stopped, we can check the services manually.
How

Prerequisite: Server Admin right is required to run it accordingly
Download the file and unzip it on your server.
List related all servers which you want to check into one TXT file, The file name must be "servers.txt"
Default mail box is ITSO Asia Computer Operations <_f7736@jabil.com> 
Use notepad open the file <Server Status After Reboot.vbs> and modify the "Email.To = " if you want to change
Remember save the script and the servers.txt file under the same folder.
Double click the script <Server Status After Reboot.vbs> after we reboot site servers.
* If the uptime > 4 hours,the uptime will be highlight and the server needs your specific attention.
* If the termservice is stopped means that we can ping the server, but the server might halt and it needs your specific attention.
* If other service is stopped, we need to check the service accordingly.
* The window "Completed! Please Check E-Mail!" will popup when the script run over, and the relative recipients will get the report mail.
